# MILP Introduction

This is a repo to get familiar with MILP formulation using Gurobi's APIs.

## Getting Started

First, you need to have docker and docker compose installed in your system.
Installing Docker Desktop installs all these things.
Then, in this folder, run this command to access all notebooks, codes:

```
docker compose up --build jupyter
```

Click on the link with the token in the output to open jupyter.

In `jupyter/` folder, I included examples from Gurobi.
